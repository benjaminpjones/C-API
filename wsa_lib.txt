/**
 * @mainpage WSA4000 LIB Documentation
 * @par Overview:
 * The WSA4000 LIB is a library with high level interfaces to a WSA4000 
 * device. It abstracts away the actual low level interface and communication 
 * through the connection of choice, and subsequently all the controls or 
 * commands to the WSA.  It allows you to easily control the WSA4000 through 
 * standardized protocols, such as SCPI, to get WSA status, set gain, 
 * set centre frequency, etc., and perform data acquisition.
 * @par
 * The WSA4000 LIB is designed using mixed C/C++ languages.  To use the 
 * library, you need to include the header file, wsa4k_lib.h, in files that 
 * will use any of its functions to access a WSA4000, and a link to 
 * the wsa4k_lib.lib.
